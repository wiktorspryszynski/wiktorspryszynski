- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wiktor SpryszyÅ„ski!
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything, at the moment I'm keen on getting some real world experience with coding
You can reach me at spryszynskiwiktor@gmail.com - if you went through my projects and have a suggestion to make on what I could've done differently - please do get in touch with me!
